Megan Dias - also known as Mycomeg - is an eclectic soul with a penchant for words and wandering.  

Her journey has brought her all the way from Bahrain where she grew up, to the USA where she now resides in an RV. 

A certified kundalini yogi, she aims to make mindfulness & meditation practices accessible to everyone; a toolbox they can utilize in their daily lives. 

As a copywriter, she helps her clients find their authentic voice and snazz-up their business with surprising ease. 

Megan is an avid explorer of consciousness, books and enjoys getting lost in her travels.

You can indulge her in talking about the whimsical world of mushrooms, your wildest dreams, and the power of random acts of kindness.
