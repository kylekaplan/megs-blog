There’s this Indian dish, khichdi, a nourishing blend traditionally made with rice, mung beans, and aromatic spices like turmeric, cloves, and cardamom. 

It makes you feel good and is a guilt-free meal that can easily be prepared in bulk. 

This past week, I decided to make a variation of it with sprouted mung beans and quinoa. Doing so reminded me of yield farming, a new investing strategy within crypto I’ve been delving into. 

Yield farming can be hard to get so maybe thinking of it in terms of bean sprouting can help you start.

If you’ve ever sprouted, you’ll know how fun the process is. You start with many hard, closed seeds/legumes/beans and end up with an abundance of *almost plants.* 

Mung beans are the easiest to sprout — you take a cup of them, clean them out, and leave them soaking in water overnight. You’ll start to see shoots the very next day, and you just keep rinsing and repeating till you get your desired sprout level. 

You’ll need to soak the legumes in a bowl or dish twice as big as it would normally fit in unsprouted, because of how they rapidly expand. You could start with a ¼ cup worth of mung beans and end up with 1-2 full cups of sprouted plants after the process. 

The health benefits are clear. Sprouting boosts the B-vitamin content of the bean astronomically and makes the nutrients more bioavailable. 

You don’t need any fancy equipment to get started, and you still reap the bountiful benefits with little effort. 

This is why it reminds me of yield farming so much. To take advantage of high returns, all you need is an internet connection and willingness to learn. 

Now, most people don’t know what yield farming is and that’s understandable. It’s a relatively new strategy but being ignorant about this is still a deficiency. Anyone with access to the internet should be learning more about the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement within the crypto space. 

Especially if you’re in my generation, here’s why: yield farming allows you to 10x your money with little to no effort, kinda like sprouting. Yield farming is simply maximizing your rate of return on your capital. You leverage the money you already have and grow it. 

Think of it like starting with that ¼ cup of beans, and ending up with 1 cup full of sprouted goodness.
