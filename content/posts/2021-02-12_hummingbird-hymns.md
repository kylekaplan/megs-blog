Three days in a row

She greeted me with laughter

A buzz so loud that

...

I could not come any

Faster. So rare a sighting

It feels like a gift

...

Whatever divine

Being orchestrated this

I offer a kiss

...

In meditation

Glorious, she’s there again

Perhaps reminding

...

Me to stay playful

Seek joy and silver linings

Therefore, finding bliss

*...*

Little warrior

You are full of good omen

Embracing nectar

...

Inspiring those who

Aren’t even looking, to

Enjoy life pleasures.
