Life lately looks like slow days and bike rides. 

Work, read, and play. 

I like it. It’s comforting. 

The other day I saw the brightest shooting star I had ever seen — blazing a path for one second before disappearing again. 

Was it a falling meteor? It looked thicker and closer than normal shooting stars. Maybe they’re the same. 

It was unexpected though, startling me from the corner of my eye during a walk around the block. 

The shooting star, and just staring at the night sky had me wondering about our ancestors — allowed a full blooming glimpse of the stars, trying to read and make sense of them. 

Crafting stories, heroes, explanations for how we got here. 

It must have been a treat to have a full sky nightly. 

I remember how I never used to see stars in Bahrain where I grew up, maybe a handful at most. When I came to USF, I was so enthralled by the sky that I’d go for late-night walks just to stare up at the stars. 

It was the most I had ever seen (and it still wasn't that many given that we were in a city). I'd sometimes go for hours at a time enjoying the simple pleasure of watching the twinkling lights above. 

I know I seemed weird to people — craned neck, oversized sweatshirt, smiling for no seeming reason — I didn’t care. I was having a blast. 

That was my first semester at college. I grew more used to the stars since then. 

They became normal, daily occurrences. 

When I’d see more than usual it’d still take my breath away. Mexico and Hawaii were the best and nothing has compared since then, but it doesn’t take the glory of stars away. 

Trips to the forest in Georgia, or the prairies in Kissimmee still have the same effect. 

How do we sustain senses of wonder? Keep it up during day-to-day life when we have a routine that doesn’t change up much? 

I prefer to live in awe — marveling at a warm, aromatic cup of tea or admiring flowers and thanking them for the views.

Maybe it’s just remembering how cool most things around us are. Nature undoubtedly seems to help. 

It’s possible to not grow numb and make sure we never lose that sense of wonder. I know it is. 

Just look up at the stars.
