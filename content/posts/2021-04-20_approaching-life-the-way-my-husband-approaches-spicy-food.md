We all experience the highs, troughs, sprints, and snail paces that life has to offer. You’ve probably come up with a way to deal with that dynamic, or maybe, like me — you’re still trying to figure it out.

No biggie, here’s a simple perspective I gleaned from observing my husband eat spicy food.

I grew up Indian and am used to the flavors, aroma, and spices my culture offers. After moving away from home 7 years ago, I don’t have it nearly as often as I’d like, and it’s always a treat when we do.

Kyle, my husband, on the other hand, grew up in a white American household and only got introduced to Indian food when we met in college. He loves it as much as I do now.

Eating it isn’t as seamless for him as it is for me, though. The man approaches his spicy food like a marathon because, even if it’s painful, he’s damn determined to eat it all.

I admire his tenacity. He loves the taste so much and is willing to put in the work that comes with eating it. It’s like a metaphor for life.

3 tips that work in tandem for approaching spicy food and life:

## WATER BREAKS

My man takes copious water breaks, and I applaud him for it.

Not only is it necessary to alleviate your burning tastebuds but entirely necessary to sustain you through life. Dehydration can degrade mental, physical, and energetic faculties, so it’s vital to drink good, quality water.

Next time you find yourself tired at work or slightly irritable — try drinking a tall glass of water. Hell, add some lemon to it if you don’t like the “flavor of water,” which some people have told me before. Your body will thank you for it.

## BREATHE

Kyle huffs and puffs during his meal to cool his tongue down.

This actually works; you can try this simple [sitali](https://www.3ho.org/kundalini-yoga/pranayam/pranayam-techniques/sitali-pranayam) pranayama (breathing practice) to cool down when angry or chili-d out. Remember, breath is life.

When I mention breathwork to people, they get confused because it seems like a natural bodily function, but many of us aren’t breathing correctly. We can induce specific states of peace and pleasure through the power of our breath.

When we start to feel anxious, we can take long, deep belly breaths to center ourselves. When we want an energy boost, we can do some rapid breath of fire through our nose. We can use breathwork as an [immune system booster](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B9pxH_bJCBS/) and induce a meditative state.

Taking a step back from whatever you’re doing will help you approach it with a fresh mind, especially if you’ve been frustrated and toiling for a long time. Take a break and breathe.

It doesn’t have to be complicated; you can do it at your desk, on the go, and even in bed. Try this [simple](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CKzYW1TAbkx/) 4–7–8 pattern and notice how you feel next time you start getting stressed.

## TAKE A WALK

Now Kyle doesn’t full-on frolick in the fields in the middle of his spicy marathon, but he will take a step away to fill up on water and move around a bit.

When it comes to working, writing, coding, etc., walks help clear your head and get you moving. It’s a mild exercise and gets to be fun. It’s helped me through depressive states, finding inspiration, and cultivating more gratitude.

Simple as it is, it has a BIG impact, so try taking a walk at the start, middle, or end of your day to switch things up. You can choose to listen to the birds, an audiobook, podcast, or nothing at all and just let your mind wander.

We need to remind ourselves more often that it’s okay to take breaks, breathe and step away. Sometimes those breaks last seconds, days, or weeks…

Then we get to revisit whatever we were doing with a certain vigor and tackle it like a plate of red hot gobi waiting to be gobbled down.

Don’t force yourself to finish everything in one sitting. Working with your energy instead of fighting it may help you out more in the long run.

Then life gets to be enjoyed at your own pace.

Is there something akin to a spicy plate of Indian food in your life that you could approach differently?

Remember, a little break never hurt anybody ;)
