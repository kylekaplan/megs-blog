life’s direction is fraught

with riddles

your next clue is in the birds that chirp,

the wind that sighs,

the ducks that mill about,

the time on the clock,

the stranger’s friendly smile,

the gentle sway of the trees,

the freshly brewed coffee,

the big dates,

and little ones,

the interactions with friends long overdue,

the flowers freshly strewn about,

the days you want to quit your job,

the days you actually leave your job,

the days your dad dies,

the days you get married,

the days where yoga saves you,

the clues are all over when you start

to get befuddled

you’re never truly lost
