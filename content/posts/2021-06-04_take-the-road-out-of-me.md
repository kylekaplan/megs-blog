It’s funny how being on the road simultaneously exhausts and excites you. 



You don’t get the same feeling when you’re on a plane. Above clouds for only a couple of hours. 



No, driving 18+ hours with minimal stops, across 4 different states is exhausting. 



Lugging a 23 foot RV that shakes when it’s a tad bit windy and you’re going over 75mph can be exhausting. 



And it’s also thrilling. 



I refer to that RV fondly as Luna. We bought her at the end of July in 2020, a spontaneous decision that we didn’t have much time to prepare for. 



It also happened to be around the time our lease at a house in St. Pete, FL was ending and we had to pack and move till we figured out what was next. We had no idea what we were doing. 



It was hectic, to say the least. 



I’d always dreamed of being on the road. Experiencing what the van-life was truly like. 



I was so excited it was finally happening. I thought I’d document and share with the world most of our adventures. That didn’t end up being the case. 



I suspect it had to do with wanting to be present more than posting about it. I didn’t want to put in the work of compiling memories to dump onto others. 



I did it in bursts. Maybe you could tell the intricacies of our RV adventures through a couple shots that I did share. But it started to progressively decline. 



And despite all the IG gurus tauting consistency and opening up your whole life for the world to see, I rebelled. I chose to be moody in my social media presence. 



How could I condense adventures into little squares on a screen? 



They deserve to be experienced and lived through. But nonetheless, they probably deserve their own posts and stories too. 



Anyways, we lived in Luna full-time and traveled around for a couple of months before deciding to find a home base again. 



We had been in Austin for 2 months, and I actually had a good routine going. I landed a new remote copywriting job, I’d head to the co-working space by 9 am, go to hot yoga at 4:30 pm, and read, write, and explore after, and sometimes in between.

It was a change from the chaotic non-plans and short stays we had in other places. It felt good. 



We actually got to know the city, its locals, and get a normal schedule going. 



I never thought routine would save me. 



But it did. And I’m grateful for the discipline. 



Now, I’ve got to sustain that, despite upheaval again. 



We rushed back to Florida from Texas to make an immigration appointment, staying at Kyle’s mom’s temporarily. 



It feels as though we’re in limbo — inbetween decisions — contemplating what’s next. 



An apartment or house. Renting the RV out or selling her? 



Visiting my family across the ocean? 



They don’t seem as daunting now that they’re written out, but it’s funny how our monkey brain can latch onto issues and make them larger than necessary. 



It’ll all work out. 



Here’s what I do know: 



We’ve given up the RV full-timing life for a more balanced lifestyle and a home base. I once opposed the idea, now I do not. 



Because I know it’s not the end. 



You’ll never be able to quite take the road out of me.
