<div style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 12px">photo taken by me during a contemplative walk </div>

emblazoned branches

reminding me of my brain,

firing new pathways

...

cerebral escapes

embarked on through dream and word,

my great odyssey

...

illuminating

the subconscious recesses

i am coming home.
