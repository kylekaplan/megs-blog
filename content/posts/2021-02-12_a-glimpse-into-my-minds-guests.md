***“How can I show up best with my gifts to serve the collective?”*** is a thought that’s been visiting me time and time again for the past couple weeks. It’s been taking up so much space in my mind, it’s a wonder I’m not collecting rent

Seriously though, I’ll gladly host this guest and let it couchsurf the ethers of my consciousness because I finally feel the urge to DO more, and that’s priceless.

I’ve been waiting for this moment — the zeal, exhilaration, spark of ambition — whatever you want to call it. It felt snuffed out for a while, and that scared me more than anything. I actually thought for a second that stagnation and complacency would win, they proved to be notable adversaries. I am so relieved that’s not the case.

So thank you, thought. I appreciate you more than you realize, *if you realize at all…* I’m aware I’m personifying the **heck** out of you. Regardless, you may stay as long as you’d like. I only ask that you clean up after yourself and leave your pesky self-limiting friends at the door. They’re not welcome.

...

So how CAN I show up? I honestly don’t have it 100% figured out and that’s A-FCKN-OKAY. I take solace in deciding what’s NOT for me, and closing those chapters out accordingly.

**This is my story, and I’m in no rush to finish the book.**
